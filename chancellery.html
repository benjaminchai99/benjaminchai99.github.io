						 <h4>Dato' Paul Leong</h4>
						 <p class="text-secondary">CHANCELLOR</p>
						 </div>
						</div>
						<p>Dato’ Paul Leong has an interesting and diverse career spanning across engineering, 
						tin mining, plantation, public service, aviation, media, and banking. After having 
						studied in the Chinese school for nine years, he pursued his education in the English 
						medium. He graduated with a Bachelor of Chemical Engineering from the University of 
						New South Wales, Australia in 1963.</p>

						<summary>Read more</summary>
						<p>Hailing from a distinguished family in Ipoh, Dato’ Paul Leong’s grandfather and father 
						had significant tin mining and plantation interests in the Kinta Valley. It is no surprise
						 that after having worked for only one year in the chemical engineering field, he 
						 joined his father’s company and gained extensive experience in these two sectors. 
						 Dato’ Paul Leong became engaged in active politics after the turbulent May riots in 
						 1969. Over the two decades ranging from 1971 to 1990, he chartered an illustrious career 
						 in party politics and in the Government. He rose swiftly from party rank to Divisional 
						 Chairman, Acting Perak State Liaison Committee Chairman, Treasurer General, Secretary 
						 General and Deputy National Chairman of Party Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia. Dato’ Paul Leong
						 was a Member of Parliament for four terms, ranging from 1974 to 1990. He was the Deputy 
						 Minister for Primary Industries from 1974 to 1978. He was promoted to the Minister of 
						 Primary Industries from 1978 to 1986, overseeing tin, natural rubber, tropical timber, 
						 palm oil, canned pineapple, pepper, cocoa and tobacco industries. Those were years when 
						 Malaysia emerged strongly in the global scene with its increased strength, dominance and 
						 influence in the commodities, especially tin, natural rubber and tropical timber, with 
						 the Primary Industries Ministry providing the crucial leadership and guidance. Indeed 
						 it is added testimony to Dato’ Paul Leong’s standing in the primary commodities sector
						 that he was appointed as Chairman of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
						 a United Nations organisation in Geneva, now known as World Trade Agreement) Negotiating 
						 Committee in Tropical Products from 1986 to 1987. Since 2004, Dato’ Paul Leong has 
						 emerged in the corporate sector. He has been holding the Independent Non-Executive 
						 Director post in Air Asia since 2004, in TSH Resources Berhad since 2005 and in the 
						 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Malaysia) since 2010. Dato’ Paul Leong was 
						 Executive Chairman for Nanyang Press Holdings Berhad from 2007 to 2009 and Executive
						 Director for Media Chinese International Limited from 2008 to 2009. He was Independent 
						 Executive Director of Sin Chew Media Corporation Berhad from 2004 to 2007.</p>
